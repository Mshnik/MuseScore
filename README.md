	+ Performance Notes
		- The most important part of performing this is authenticity. Musical precision is less important than the conveying camaraderie, vulnerability, and uplifting joy with the right energy and emotion in the appropriate places.
		- Any performance of this should use at least 2 soloists. Change soloists at Verse 2 (rehearsal markings D), and switch to a duet or change to another soloist at the bridge (rehearsal marking G).
		- Backing vocals are structured as a chorus of women's voices and a chorus of ally voices (in commonly male voice ranges). By design, this arrangement focuses on celebrating women's voices while the ally chorus part is simpler, but an engaged ally chorus that is supporting the musical/stylistic choices of the women's chorus will empower the women's chorus to convey the more complex texture and ornaments. Please sing earnestly regardless of your part!
